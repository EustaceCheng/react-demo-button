I expect a page, with the requirement:
There are 10 buttons. Every button contains a different number value.
If a button is clicked, it shows that it is clicked. Please use css/style to indicate it is clicked.
When a clicked button is clicked again, it shows it is un-clicked. Its css will be reset.
Display the all values of currently clicked buttons on the page.
Display the sum of values of currently clicked buttons on the page.
